# Hi there, I'm your helpbook! ðŸ‘‹


# Project Intro

In this project, you'll build the basics of a fully-functional profile/link sharing application. This will assess your technical proficiency and ability to create something from scratch from basic requirements.


## Tasks

- Clone the repo to get started. The assets folder contains pictures of a mockup for a simple application.
- Using any framework of your choice, create the frontend and backend of the application. (see suggested tech stack below if you want bonus points)
- Save your project to your github.
- Share the link of the github repo with instructions on how to run.
- Provide us with some times to connect to show off your work/answer followup questions.


## Project Requirements
Your application should fulfill the following minimum requirements:
- **Create User and Profile links** - Using image1 and image2 as references, there should be a page where you can enter information for a user. This page should allow you to save the user.
- **Display User** - Using image3 as reference, there should be a page where it displays the saved information of the user.
- **Cross Platform** - Make the web-application responsive for multiple platform like laptop, tablet, phone.

Bonus points for additional features.

## FAQ's

#### How much time do I have to build this?

Answer - The project is meant to assess your mastery of full stack development. You can spend as much time as you want to build but we recommend you don't need to spend more than 4-5 hours for this. 
We care more about the actual implementation of the task rather than completion.

#### Do I need to clone the sample images exactly?

Answer - Nope, as long as the core elements are there and the UI looks reasonably similar, it is fine. You do not have to make a 100% perfect copy of the template images as we care more about the functional knowledge than fixing every line of CSS.

#### Do I need to deploy the application somewhere?

Answer - No, but please include instructions on how to run the application locally.

#### What do I need to prepare for the followup call?

Answer - Walk us through your application. What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them? What is something you would implement if you put in more time?
